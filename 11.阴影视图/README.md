This is a simple `UIView` subclass that allows for setting both a corner radius and a drop shadow. 

## Installation

Clone or download the repository and and manually add the file `ShadowView.swift` to your project and target.

## Usage

The shadow view can be used with storyboards or be created in code. The properties for `cornerRadius`, `shadowOffset`, `shadowRadius`, `shadowOpacity` and `shadowColor` can be set via Interface Builder.
